# Blocks To Commands

Spigot plugin that allows the user to assign a command to a block. When The block is right-clicked the command assigned to it will be exucuted.
The command will either be exucuted by the player right-clicking the block or by the console depending on the configuration of the plugin.

## Getting Started

Clone / Fork the project to get the code on your local machine.
Once you have the code, you will need to add the spigot and vault jar file as libraries so the code an be compiled into a jar file.

After the code has been compiled into a jar file it is ready to be used as a spigot plugin. 

### Installing

Drag and drop the compiled jar file into the plugins folder generated by the spigot server.
